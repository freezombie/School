	<li><h3>Xbox</h3><p>I think i bought this, played some games on it and sold it extremely fast</p></li>
	<li><h3>Close Combat series</h3><p>Awesome series, really hope to see similar games sometime again. I really enjoyed that the soldies had names, and they moved on with you and their stats and kills and stuff were tracked. It made for nice stories</p></li>

	<li><h3>Age of Empires II</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Commandos 2</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Princess Maker 2</h3><p>Yeah i know... I played pretty much anything when i lived in Spain. Whatever my computer could run. Anyhow awesome game, awesome mechanics build into storytelling etc</p></li>
	<li><h3>Abandonware games</h3><p>Special mention to abandonware games. I visited home of the underdogs everyday and played a hell of a lot of games from that site, mostly because i had a sucky computer, but some games were really awesome</p></li>

	<li><h3>Gangsters series</h3></li>

	<li><h3>Deus Ex</h3><p>I was blown away</p></li>
	<li><h3>Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</h3><p>This is still the best game in the series, very often i just randomly have thoughts of this game... So awesome. Also did some stuff in a editor for the first time ever. And yeah, played every single game and expansion since</p></li>
	<li><h3>Day of Defeat</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Made account on Steam</h3><p>Wow that really blew up afterwards. I only made the move because DoD stand-alone was no longer supported</p><time>Member since 19 April, 2004</time></li>
	<li><h3>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</h3><p>First time in a clan, we played maybe two matches though. Rest of the time we were just playing around in public servers</p></li>
	<li><h3>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</h3><p>Not sure which one i played first, but i've played many of the games since. The most latest ones are shit though.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Jet Set Radio</h3><p>Awesome soundtrack too</p></li>
	<li><h3>Shenmue</h3><p>Extremely memorable! Played it through a couple of times since. I didn't buy it at first, but i loaned a friends dreamcast with some games</p></li>
	<li><h3>Metal Gear Solid series</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Anno 1602</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Elastomania and Across</h3><p>Recently when playing Trials games, i can really feel how the creators must have played these games aswell ^^</p></li>
	<li><h3>World of Warcraft</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Day of Defeat: Source</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Global Operations</h3><p>Sort of the "prequel" to CSS for me</p></li>
	<li><h3>Counter-Strike: Source</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Hidden & Dangerous</h3><p>And it's sequel.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Ring of Red</h3><p>This seems like a pretty random game to remember</p></li>
	<li><h3>Star Trek: Starfleet Command</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Syphon Filter</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Hitman series</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Kessen series</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Soldier of Fortune</h3><p>And it's sequel</p></li>
	<li><h3>The Sims</h3><p>and it's sequels... Yeah i'm such a hardcore gamer</p></li>
	<li><h3>Sudden Strike series</h3></li>
	<li><h3>No One Lives Forever</h3><p>And it's sequel. I really liked the harpoon gun that made enemies stick to the walls. Ofcourse also the setting and theme</p></li>
	<li><h3>Black & White</h3><p>And it's sequel. It makes me so sad that this series was abandoned for fable :( I really loved raising the creature</p></li>
	<li><h3>Empire Earth</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Europa Universalis II</h3><p>Didn't like this series so much before EU 4, but this was my first contact to the series</p></li>
	<li><h3>IL-2 Sturmovik</h3><p>This is probably the best flight sim still.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Max Payne</h3><p>And every game afterwards. Oh god the hype when this released</p></li>
	<li><h3>Operation Flashpoint</h3><p>and it's expansions and some of the sequels. This was so awesome, and i really feel the series was not as good as this game afterwards. I made some missions also in the mission creator</p></li>
	<li><h3>Red Faction 1 and 2</h3><p>I think this was the first time i saw destructible 3d environment. Rest of the series isn't as good</p></li>
	<li><h3>Uplink</h3><p>For a long time i thought hacking was like this :D</p></li>
	<li><h3>Unreal World</h3><p>I think i played this survival game the first time around this time. Learned to appreciate it much much later</p></li>
	<li><h3>Battlefield 1942</h3><p>Played this a lot in lan cafes and at home. So much fun! Played every single game since then i think</p></li>
	<li><h3>The Getaway</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Jennifer Government: NationStates</h3><p>A browser game, but including it here since it was the first government simulation game i played i think. It was awesome</p></li>
	<li><h3>Mafia</h3><p>And it's sequel later on</p></li>
	<li><h3>Prisoner of War</h3><p>Stealth game in real life settings, what is this!?</p></li>
	<li><h3>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</h3><p>Not sure if i started from the first game, but i have played every game</p></li>
	<li><h3>State of Emergency</h3><p>Just chaos</p></li>
	<li><h3>Unreal Tournament 2003</h3><p>Please make more unreal tournament games, please? I have a fun memory of trying to install this game for a friend at a lan party for many hours, then totally owning him so much that he quit and uninstalled the game after 10 minutes.</p></li>

	<li><h3>Half-Life 2</h3><p>And the episodes that were released</p></li>
