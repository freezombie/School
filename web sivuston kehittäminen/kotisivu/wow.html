	<h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
	<p>So i played World of Warcraft actively since it's release up to the launch of Wrath of the Lich King. After that i played now and then for a couple of months each time.
	I really loved The Burning Crusade, cataclysm's start was awesome too. Rest of the expansions were kind of 'meh'. 
	Classic was awesome in some ways, with it's 40 man raids etc, but i believe time has just made those memories golden even though the actual mechanics weren't that good back then. 
	Ofcourse i remember awesome guildmates aswell so that's part of the reason why i remember classic WoW fondly.</p>
	<p>Anyhow i meant to have many pictures here from those times, but apparently they have vanished so tough luck i guess. Only found a couple of very random pics that aren't really worthy of putting up.</p>
	<p>WoW for me started when i got the game a day before release, guess the postman made a mistake. 
	I launched 2 guilds for Finnish speakers only and left both of them shortly, mostly because i was jumping around characters trying to find a class/side i would enjoy. 
	I formed Frozen Throne that imploded for whatever reason. I also formed Arctica that later became famous raiders... 
	I had nothing to do with the raiding part, but i'm glad they made it far. I kinda regret leaving them haha, i played until level 40 or so on that character</p>
	<p>I had met some finnish dude from Helsinki playing alts i think and he proposed that we should share an account that had a 60 level rogue on it.
	His reason was that he could only raid until 8/9/10 and my parents were a bit more lenient on me playing games.
	So we did that, it was my first 60 character in a way, i reached level cap with an actual character of my own much later on. This was an undead rogue by the name of Cradow in Kaamos - Burning Blade EU.
	I think the guild migrated to a different server at some point, but i can't remember which. 
	This collaboration ended with the dude from Helsinki selling the account for 500 euros and not giving me a single penny, he apologized some years later.
	Our character was quite geared at this point, the guild had progressed quite fast.</p>
	<p>I played a tauren warrior named Chairul with another friend for a very short while during classics end-times. 
	That friend just sort of dissapeared suddenly and changed passwords and stuff, i actually have no clue what happended to him.
	</p>
	<p>At this point i was in high-school and an acquaintance had an extra character that he no longer played, he gave that to me. 
	This was just in time for The Burning Crusade launch if i remember right. I named this character Ghirian, an orc rogue. I joined a guild called The Esoteric Foundation on Defias Brotherhood EU.
	I played with them for most of TBC. It was a pretty hardcore raiding guild, i really enjoyed playing with them and topped dps meters constantly, but at some point it seemed like progress had stopped and raiding felt more like work than fun so i changed guild to Fear the Rabbit.
	</p>
	<p>Fear the Rabbit was a finnish guild that most of my friends had migrated into at some point. I got in by pure luck i guess, they needed someone for their Kael'Thas run and i just happended to be there when friends were asking around.
	I played with them until Wotlk, and stopped when i got kicked when i went to my summer job. I was so angry that i never returned during wotlk, i had made a post about my job beforehand so it felt really unjustified.
	</p>
	<p>I joined a guild that was made for our IRL friends when a little bit before cataclysm came and raided with them until quitting once more. 
	I think we had killed some HC bosses and al'ar(and some wotlk bosses). That was fun. 
	I had leveled a blood elf paladin to level cap during wotlk and played that mostly from there on. I healed. I returned to FtR for some time in Cataclysm, but quit once again since the game seemed to be going to shit.
	</p>
	<p>I tried mists of pandaria, i didn't like how they designed the heroic drops and the boss kill badges rewards. 
	Since i didn't like how dungeoning and pve before raids worked i figured i wouldn't like raiding either, 
	I also didn't really want to commit again to FtR's raiding rules and schedules so i just stopped playing WoW altogether.</p>
	<h3>Real Life effects of WoW</h3>
	<p>I mentioned in short history how i made many friends in WoW. Well i did, online friends and IRL friends both</p>
	<p>Online friends are pretty much gone now, but i remember fondly people who raided with me for a while in Emeritus and transitioned with me from that guild into The Esoteric Foundation.
	Grunee was a dude from Denmark who listened to reggae and was overall an awesome dude. Brottick and Dreadrick seemed like they were brothers, but if i remember right they were flatmates. 
	Brottick died in a car accident, he played a rogue the same as me, we often messaged each other about rogue stuff... Which build was most fun to play etc</p>
	<p>There were also Armagedda who was somehow involved in the norwegian black metal scene, and ofcourse everyone from Fear the Rabbit, listing the people from there would take a too long time. Many of them i also met IRL</p>
	<p>When i played WoW i often visited a gaming cafe called "Pelikahvila Nook" in Oulu, i made many friends there because of WoW. We played together, and most of the people i met during that time are my friends still.</p>
	<p>When i was studying in Karjasilta i also talked about WoW with many people who were playing the game aswell, made friends with some.</p>
