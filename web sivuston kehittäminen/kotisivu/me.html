				<h3 class="white">Short history</h3>
				<p>I was born. Some childhood things happended like learning to ride a bike and getting vaccinations. Nothing hugely interesting<br>
				I got my first computer as a christmas or birthday present in 1995, and since then i've been using the computer way too much, according to everyone else.<br>
				Well it wasn't all like that in the beginning, just innocently playing alley cat or stunts, then going out to hang with friends or play football.<br>
				I played football in Ajax, not the real one ofcourse, we won some Oulu cups or something. I was so little it is kinda hard to remember all the details, this was back around 1998<br>
				</p>
				<p>After football, i started doing general athletics. I was especially good at running and long jump if i remember correctly.<br>
				My mother signed me up for wrestling even though i was going to some tournament in Helsinki for the general athletics thing, i had zero practice for that for 6 months or so<br>
				I quit wrestling quite soon after starting it, after my first official match in fact. It didn't really seem like my thing, even though i did win the first match because my opponent thought he was doing WWE and broke the rules. He kind of won the match anyhow in my view, i was weaker.<br>
				</p>
				<p>At around this time my parents divorced, and I lived with my mother in a different house for some time. Shortly thereafter we moved to Spain.<br>
				In Spain my mother and his new upcoming husband bought a little restaurant near the docks. It was a fun time in general, though i mostly had "friends" who were in their retirement age.<br>
				I can see the effect of my stay in Spain quite easily in my life, i'm really missing some basic knowledge that was taught in Finnish pre-schools. Talking is sometimes a bit hard for me still, but i think that's also because of me spending so much time on the internet speaking english instead of finnish.<br>
				I played Football and did Taekwon-Do for the duration of my stay.
				</p>
				<p>Around this time (2001 onwards) i really started to get into games, i had played them before ofcourse, but I started to think of them as a hobby, became a bit obsessed with them I guess you could say.<br>
				I really regret that i did not get into competitive gaming all that much then. I played mostly single player games, i really loved <b>Deus Ex</b> and <b>Morrowind</b>. Still do, planning to get tattoos at some point even. Make it so that those tattoos show the contrast between cyberpunk scifi and fantasy.<br>
				</p>
				<p>I moved back to Finland at some point, got into seventh grade. In Finland i finally started playing some competitive games like Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source. I had been a big fan of the earlier Day of Defeat too.<br>
				Then World of Warcraft happended. There went all competitive aspirations, but i really loved the game and it's community. I made many friends through and because of this game, even in real life.<br>
